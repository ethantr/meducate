# Meducare

Meducare is an AI-powered healthcare education app designed to improve health literacy through personalised lessons and interactive quizzes. Developed as a part of a 24-hour hackathon, Meducare provides a gamified experience that makes learning about healthcare engaging and accessible.

## Features
- Personalised Learning: Users receive tailored lessons based on their progress and understanding of health literacy topics.
- Interactive Quizzes: Engaging quizzes reinforce learning and provide immediate feedback to users.
- Gamified Experience: By integrating elements of gamification, users are encouraged to stay engaged with the content, making health education more fun.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Built with Next.js, providing a fast, scalable, and efficient user interface.
- Backend: Powered by AWS services for the backend infrastructure and database (only operational during the hackathon).
- AI Models: Leveraged models like Claude and Google Gemini to generate personalised content (not currently active but used during development).

## Development Notes
This project was put together during a 24-hour hackathon, so you’ll definitely notice the classic "throw everything together and hope it works" approach. The code’s a bit chaotic (hackathon fashion!), but we got a working MVP by the end.
What's Working: The frontend is built in Next.js, and we used AWS for the backend and database (which only ran during the hackathon). We also integrated Claude and Google Gemini for AI-generated content – but heads up, the AI models aren’t currently live.
Right now, the backend and AI stuff aren’t active, but we’ve got plans to bring Meducare back one day when things are less hectic.
Shoutout to @TaiHaDev, @naychithanshwe, and EntroSanity – lot of Red Bulls and not a lot of sleep got us through this one!
